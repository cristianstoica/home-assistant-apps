# Weather Verify (`wxverify`)

Weather Verify is a local Home Assistant add-on and standalone FastAPI app for
checking forecast-model skill against a cluster of Weather.com PWS stations.

It stores all state in SQLite, builds an observation consensus from enabled PWS
stations, pairs forecasts against that consensus, and serves both a JSON API and
a small HTMX/uPlot web UI.

## What Operators Need

- Python 3.13 for local standalone use.
- `uv` for local dependency management.
- A Weather.com PWS API key for station validation and observation refresh.
- Optional Meteoblue API key if that forecast provider is enabled.
- One or more PWS station IDs near each verification site.
- A writable data directory for the SQLite database and options file.

Temperature values are stored and displayed in Celsius, wind in m/s, and
precipitation in mm.

## Local Standalone Start

Standalone start for local development:

```sh
# from the wxverify/ add-on directory
uv sync --frozen
uv run python -m wxverify --db .local/wxverify.db serve
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8099/dashboard
```

The first start creates the SQLite database automatically.

Optional overrides:

```sh
export WXV_DB_PATH="$PWD/.local/wxverify.db"
export WXV_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export WXV_PORT="8099"
```

## Local Environment Variables

Local standalone mode reads environment variables when no Home Assistant
`/data/options.json` file exists. Export these in the shell environment that
starts the app:

```sh
export WXV_WEATHERCOM_KEY="YOUR_WEATHERCOM_KEY"
export WXV_METEOBLUE_KEY=""
export WXV_VISUALCROSSING_KEY=""
export WXV_OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY=""
export WXV_WEATHERAPI_KEY=""
export WXV_METEOSOURCE_KEY=""
export WXV_GOOGLE_KEY=""
export WXV_ROLLING_WINDOW_DAYS=30
export WXV_MIN_N=30
export WXV_OBS_INTERVAL_MINUTES=180
export WXV_OBS_JITTER_MINUTES=20
export WXV_LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

Blank provider keys are treated as missing.

To verify the current shell has the variables loaded without printing secrets:

```sh
print ${+WXV_WEATHERCOM_KEY}
```

`1` means the key is set in the current shell.

## Home Assistant Add-on Configuration

When run as a Home Assistant add-on, runtime options come from
`/data/options.json` and state is stored at:

```text
/data/wxverify.db
```

The add-on config exposes these options:

| Option                 | Required         | Default | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `weathercom_key`       | Yes for stations | empty   | Weather.com PWS validation and observation pulls |
| `meteoblue_key`        | No               | empty   | Meteoblue forecast provider                      |
| `visualcrossing_key`   | No               | empty   | Visual Crossing Timeline forecast provider       |
| `openweathermap_key`   | No               | empty   | OpenWeatherMap One Call forecast provider        |
| `weatherapi_key`       | No               | empty   | WeatherAPI.com forecast provider                 |
| `meteosource_key`      | No               | empty   | Meteosource forecast provider                    |
| `google_key`           | No               | empty   | Google Weather forecast provider                 |
| `rolling_window_days`  | No               | `30`    | Default rolling score window                     |
| `min_n`                | No               | `30`    | Minimum paired samples for confident scores      |
| `obs_interval_minutes` | No               | `180`   | Base observation refresh cadence                 |
| `obs_jitter_minutes`   | No               | `20`    | Per-cycle bounded jitter for PWS refreshes       |
| `log_level`            | No               | `info`  | Runtime logging level                            |

The add-on serves through Home Assistant Ingress. Do not pass an extra root path
to uvicorn; the app owns `root_path` internally.

## First-run Workflow

1. Start the app.
2. Open the Sites page.
3. Create a site with:
   - name
   - forecast latitude and longitude
   - reference elevation in meters
   - IANA timezone, for example `Europe/Bucharest`
   - rain threshold in mm
4. Add at least one Weather.com PWS station to the site.
5. Confirm provider key status on the Ops page.
6. Let the worker run. It refreshes PWS observations, materializes consensus,
   and queues scoring work when observations change.

Site creation does not require a Weather.com key. Adding a station does require
the key because the station ID is validated synchronously.

### Site Field Notes

`rain_threshold_mm` defines what counts as a rain event for precipitation
scoring.

Precipitation is scored two ways:

- as an amount error: forecast mm vs observed mm
- as an event classification: did it rain or not?

The threshold is used for the event part:

```text
rain event = hourly precip >= rain_threshold_mm
```

That lets wxverify compute metrics like POD, FAR, CSI, ETS, and HSS without
treating tiny trace or noisy values as real rain.

The default is `0.2 mm`, which is a reasonable "trace rain counts as dry" floor.
You usually do not need to change it unless your station reports noisy tiny
precip amounts or you want a stricter definition such as `1.0 mm`.

It only affects precipitation event scoring. Temperature and wind are
unaffected. Changing it later recomputes precip pairs and cached scores for that
site.

`elevation_m` is the reference elevation for the verification location. wxverify
uses it when building the temperature consensus: station temperatures are
lapse-normalized to the site elevation before taking the median. That keeps a
station higher or lower than the target location from biasing the ground-truth
temperature.

Use meters above sea level. If you do not know the exact value, use a reasonable
estimate from a map, GPS, or elevation lookup. It does not need centimeter
precision, but it should not be empty or wildly wrong.

For a simple source of latitude, longitude, and elevation, use FreeMapTools
Elevation Finder:

```text
https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm
```

Search for the location or click the map point, then copy the latitude,
longitude, and estimated elevation in meters.

## How Verification Works

wxverify does not score forecasts against each PWS station separately. For each
site, hour, and variable, it first fuses the enabled station cluster into one
consensus observation. That single consensus value is the ground truth used for
all model scoring.

For temperature, each station reading is lapse-normalized to the site's
`elevation_m` before aggregation, using `0.0065 C/m` (`6.5 C/km`). For example,
a station 200 m higher than the site is adjusted upward by about `1.3 C` before
the cluster median is computed. Wind and precipitation are not elevation
adjusted.

After basic station QC, the consensus step rejects outliers fresh for each
`(site, variable, hour)` using median absolute deviation, then stores the median
of the surviving readings in `observations`. Rejection is per-hour and
per-variable; a station rejected for one bad hour can still contribute normally
on the next hour. The stored `n_stations` and `rejected_stations` values are
diagnostics for that consensus row.

The Ops page has a station-trust diagnostic that compares each station with the
consensus over time. It is informational only and does not change scoring.

Forecasts use one configured query point per site: `forecast_lat` and
`forecast_lon`. Every forecast feed uses that same point so model comparisons
are fair. The app still makes separate provider calls per effective feed:
Open-Meteo feeds are fetched per model, and Meteoblue is fetched as one
multimodel package that expands into member-model samples. Observation refreshes
fetch each enabled PWS station independently.

Scoring pairs each model forecast with the one consensus observation for the
same site, variable, and valid hour. Metrics are grouped by site, feed, variable,
day-ahead lead bucket, and rolling window. A model can therefore rank well for
day-1 temperature and poorly for day-5 precipitation; those are separate score
cells.

## Forecast Horizon

wxverify is configured to request and score up to `168` lead hours, which is
`7` days, for all forecast feeds.

- Open-Meteo live forecasts request `forecast_hours=168`.
- Meteoblue package data is filtered to `lead_hours <= 168`.
- Open-Meteo historical backfill stores previous-run day-ahead leads from
  day 1 through day 7.

Actual stored coverage can be shorter when a provider or member model returns a
shorter horizon. For example, some regional Meteoblue models may stop at 72, 96,
120, or 144 hours even though wxverify's scoring limit is 168 hours.

## Web UI

Main pages:

```text
/dashboard
/sites
/ops
/overlay
```

The UI uses CSRF-protected HTMX JSON actions. Mutating actions are not plain HTML
forms; if a session token expires after a restart, reload the page and retry.

### Dashboard Guide

The Dashboard answers: which forecast feed is best for this site, variable,
time window, and lead time?

Top controls:

- Site pills choose the verification site.
- `Last N days` / `All time` chooses the scoring window. `Last N days` uses the
  `rolling_window_days` setting.
- `Temperature` / `Precipitation` / `Wind` chooses the variable.
- The lead control chooses the day-ahead bucket, labelled by word — `Today`,
  `Tomorrow`, then `+2 days` through `+7 days` — with the `D+n` code shown small
  beside each. `Today` is same-day, `Tomorrow` is next-day, and so on through 7
  days ahead.

Dashboard panels:

- `Best forecast` (top card) names, in plain words, the single best feed for the
  current site, variable, window, and lead, with its runner-up and how many
  verified forecasts back it. When the top two are too close to separate it says
  so instead, and when no feed beats its baseline it adds that caveat.
- `Leaderboard` is the main ranking for the selected site, variable, window,
  and lead. `Samples` is the number of matched forecast-vs-observation pairs.
  `Skill` is a `0-100` badge: temperature and wind use skill against the
  persistence baseline, while precipitation uses ETS for rain-event
  classification; a warn-coloured badge means the feed scored at or below its
  baseline. `MAE` and `RMSE` are error magnitudes where lower is better. A feed
  is ranked — and given a rank number — only once it has both enough verified
  pairs (`n >= min_n`, default `30`) and a skill score that can actually be
  computed; sample count alone is not enough, and feeds that fall short are
  withheld with the reason shown in place of a score. The best-scoring ranked
  feed is the one to trust; use `MAE`, `RMSE`, and `Samples` to judge how large
  the errors were and how much data supports the score.
- `Skill Curve` plots a separate line per feed across the day-ahead buckets
  (`Today` through `+7 days`), with the lead axis labelled in words. Use it to
  see how each feed's skill changes as the forecast lead gets longer.
- `Win Rate` counts comparable valid-hour cells where a feed was closest to the
  consensus. `Covered` is how many cells the feed covered. `Rate` is the share
  of comparable cells it won; ties are split fractionally. This is different
  from skill because a model can win many hours but still have worse RMSE if its
  misses are large.
- `Composite` is an overall read-side score across available variables and lead
  buckets for the selected site/window. Negative skill components are floored at
  `0`, then available components are averaged and ranked.

Virtual feeds can appear beside provider feeds:

- `Persistence` is the baseline feed. For each lead, it predicts that the
  future hour will equal the observed consensus from the same lead time ago. For
  example, a 6-hour persistence forecast for 12:00 uses the observed value from
  06:00. Temperature and wind skill are measured against this baseline; a model
  worse than persistence is shown as `0 below baseline`.
- `Multimodel Mean` is a synthetic competitor built by averaging active real
  model forecasts for the same site, variable, issued time, valid time, and
  lead. It is created only when at least two active real models contribute. It
  is not an external provider call.

## CLI

All CLI commands use the same SQLite database path:

```sh
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db <command>
```

Available commands:

```sh
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db serve --options /path/to/options.json
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db fetch <site_id> <feed_id>
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db score [--site-id <site_id>]
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db backfill <site_id>
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db catchup
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db settings list
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db settings get <key>
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db settings set <key> <value>
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db sources set-cap <source> --daily-call-limit <n>
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db providers doctor --site-id <site_id>
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db providers reconcile
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db providers enable --site-id <site_id> --all-new
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db providers fetch --site-id <site_id> --source visualcrossing
python -m wxverify --db /path/to/wxverify.db providers smoke --site-id <site_id> --all-new
```

Changing `rolling_window_days` through the settings path invalidates old cached
scores. Other settings are plain runtime knobs.

Provider operations are local admin commands. `doctor`, `reconcile`,
`enable`, `disable`, and enqueue-only `providers fetch` do not call external
forecast APIs. `providers fetch --run-now` and `providers smoke` perform live
provider calls and consume provider budget.

`providers reconcile` is safe to run against a live database when seed catalog
rows are missing; it inserts missing `sources` and `feeds` rows without
overwriting edited caps or feed settings. New or changed Python adapter code
still requires restarting the app process so the running interpreter loads that
code.

## Operational Notes

- SQLite runs in WAL mode.
- All writes are serialized through one writer connection.
- The observation refresh window is fixed at six hours in code, not a setting.
- Weather.com PWS calls are budgeted per enabled station.
- A site with no enabled stations is not observation-due and does not advance
  `last_obs_at`.
- Forecast and observation provider keys are never stored in the database.
- `/api/health/keys` reports only present or absent, never secret values.

## Logging

The add-on writes structured log lines to the add-on log (Settings → Add-ons → Weather
Verify → Log). Each line is prefixed with a timestamp, level, and the component that
emitted it, e.g.:

```text
2026-07-10T14:03:11+0000 INFO wxverify.worker.processor cycle: job=42 type=fetch_feed site=1 outcome=completed
```

The four levels, loudest to quietest:

- **ERROR — act now.** Something failed and will not fix itself: the worker crashed, a job
  gave up after exhausting its retries, a forecast or observation fetch failed permanently,
  or the add-on could not write to its database. If you see ERROR, the add-on needs you.
- **WARNING — notice, but it handled itself.** The add-on hit a snag and recovered or is
  degrading gracefully: a provider asked it to back off (rate limit), a job failed once and
  will retry, a feed provider is temporarily unavailable, a fetch was skipped because the
  daily API budget was used up, or a fetch came back with no usable samples. Nothing to do
  unless WARNINGs are constant.
- **INFO — it's working, here's the heartbeat.** The default level. You'll see the worker
  start and stop, one `cycle: …` line each time the worker finishes a unit of work (naming the
  job and its outcome — completed, deferred, retry, or failed), and one `scoring run complete …`
  line per scoring run. If these keep ticking over, the add-on is alive and doing its job. INFO
  never prints per-operation detail.
- **DEBUG — show me literally everything.** The full firehose: every forecast fetch, every
  observation fetch, every scoring phase, every queue and worker transition, every backfill
  and catch-up step, every database transaction, and the raw HTTP requests and responses.
  Use this when you're diagnosing a specific problem; it is very verbose.

### Setting the level

Set `log_level` in the add-on configuration (Settings → Add-ons → Weather Verify →
Configuration) to one of `error`, `warning`, `info` (default), or `debug`, then restart the
add-on. The chosen level applies to the running service **and** to any one-shot command you
run inside the add-on container (for example the CLI `fetch`, `score`, `backfill`, and
`catchup` commands) — so `log_level: debug` gives you the full trace for a manual command
too, not just the background worker.

### API keys are never logged

Forecast and observation providers are called with your API keys in the request URL. Every
log line that could contain a URL — including the raw HTTP request lines at `debug` — has
its secret query parameters stripped before it is written, so keys are replaced with a
redaction marker — which appears in the log as `%2A%2A%2A`, the URL-encoded form of `***`:

```text
2026-07-10T14:03:11+0000 DEBUG httpx HTTP Request: GET https://api.example.com/v1/forecast?key=%2A%2A%2A "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
```

This means a `debug` log is safe to copy into a bug report or share for support without
leaking credentials.

## Monitoring

As a Home Assistant add-on, wxverify's **process supervision** is the
Supervisor's Watchdog, gated by the add-on's **Watchdog toggle** in the HA UI.
With the toggle on, the Supervisor restarts the add-on on either of two
signals: a clean crash (the worker exits and the container halts), or the
Docker `HEALTHCHECK` (in `Dockerfile`, probing `/api/sites`) reporting the
container unhealthy — a deliberately lax envelope (60 s interval × 10 retries,
so ~10-11 minutes to trip). With the toggle off, neither triggers a restart: a
crashed worker stays halted and data collection stops silently.

The generous healthcheck envelope is deliberate: a long scoring transaction or
boot-time catchup can starve the event loop and miss a probe or two, and a
tighter envelope would restart a healthy add-on mid-run — a false restart with
no actual hang. The cost is the ~10-11 minute detection window for an app that
is genuinely wedged. Turning the Watchdog toggle off is an emergency stopgap
only — it disables all Supervisor restarts, including crash recovery.

**Proactive alerting** is HA-native. The add-on exposes a read-only verdict
endpoint, `GET /api/health/monitor`, which runs pipeline (group 1), budget
(group 2), and DB-integrity (group 4) threshold checks against its own database
and returns a structured verdict (`overall` = `ok` / `warning` / `critical`,
plus per-condition detail). It always responds `200` with a verdict body — even
on a database read error, which surfaces as `db_readable:false` /
`overall:critical` rather than an HTTP failure. Each group can be turned off via
the `monitor_pipeline`, `monitor_budget`, and `monitor_db` options; a disabled
group runs no queries and its conditions report `skipped`.

Home Assistant owns the poll loop and delivery: a **REST sensor** polls
`/api/health/monitor` on the internal add-on network, and two **automations**
send a persistent notification plus a mobile push when the verdict degrades and
clear the notification on recovery. If the add-on is down, the REST sensor goes
`unavailable` — that is the "add-on not responding" signal. It covers a crash
with the Watchdog toggle off (the add-on stays halted), startup/migration
failures that abort before any request is served, and the window while the
Supervisor's Watchdog restarts the add-on after a trip. A brief `unavailable`
that clears on its own is consistent with a Watchdog-triggered restart —
confirm in the Supervisor log, which shows
a `Watchdog found app Weather Verify ...` line.
The runtime health routes `/api/health/*` and
`/api/worker/status` remain available for ad-hoc inspection.

### Home Assistant package (REST sensor + automations)

Paste these into your HA configuration to poll the verdict endpoint and alert
when it degrades.

**Resolve the add-on host.** The add-on is reachable from HA core over the
internal Docker network at `http://<repo>-wxverify:8099/api/health/monitor`,
where `<repo>` depends on the install method: a repo hash for a store install
from `github.com/cristianstoica/home-assistant-apps` (e.g.
`http://3283fh-wxverify:8099/...`), or `http://local-wxverify:8099/...` for a
local/dev install. The literal `<repo>` prefix cannot be derived from the repo
alone — confirm it once from an HA terminal: the sensor must return `200` with a
verdict body at the resolved host.

**REST sensor:**

```yaml
rest:
  - resource: http://<repo>-wxverify:8099/api/health/monitor
    scan_interval: 300  # seconds — primary load dial; raise to poll less often
    sensor:
      - name: "wxverify monitor"
        unique_id: wxverify_monitor
        value_template: "{{ value_json.overall }}"
        json_attributes:
          - conditions
          - grace_active
          - generated_at
```

**Automation — degraded** (sends a persistent notification plus a mobile push;
repoint `notify.mobile_app_<your_device>` to your app's entity):

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "wxverify degraded"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.wxverify_monitor
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: >
          {{ states('sensor.wxverify_monitor') not in ('ok', 'unavailable', 'unknown') }}
    action:
      - variables:
          tripped: >
            {{ state_attr('sensor.wxverify_monitor', 'conditions')
               | selectattr('ok', 'equalto', false)
               | selectattr('skipped', 'equalto', false)
               | map(attribute='id') | list | join(', ') }}
      - service: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          notification_id: wxverify_monitor
          title: "wxverify: {{ states('sensor.wxverify_monitor') }}"
          message: "Tripped: {{ tripped }}"
      - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device>
        data:
          title: "wxverify: {{ states('sensor.wxverify_monitor') }}"
          message: "Tripped: {{ tripped }}"
```

**Automation — recovered** (clears the notification on return to `ok`):

```yaml
  - alias: "wxverify recovered"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.wxverify_monitor
        to: "ok"
    action:
      - service: persistent_notification.dismiss
        data:
          notification_id: wxverify_monitor
```

## API Call Budget

Steady-state provider usage depends on the number of enabled sites, enabled
stations, enabled forecast feeds, and fetch cadence.

With the default cadences, each enabled site makes:

- Weather.com PWS: one call per enabled station per observation cycle. With the
  default `obs_interval_minutes=180` and up to `obs_jitter_minutes=20`, that is
  roughly `7.2` to `8` cycles per day.
- Open-Meteo forecasts: one call per enabled Open-Meteo model every
  `360` minutes, or `4` calls per model per day.
- Meteoblue: one multimodel package call every `360` minutes, or `4` calls per
  enabled site per day. The current package costs `16000` credits per call.

For an example deployment with one enabled site, 8 enabled stations, 7 enabled
Open-Meteo models, and the Meteoblue package enabled, the expected steady-state
use is:

| Provider        |          Expected steady-state use |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------: |
| Weather.com PWS |            about `56-64` calls/day |
| Open-Meteo      |                     `28` calls/day |
| Meteoblue       | `4` calls/day, `64000` credits/day |

The default wxverify caps are:

| Provider    |    Call cap |  Credit cap |
| ----------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| Weather.com |  `1000/day` |        none |
| Open-Meteo  | `10000/day` |        none |
| Meteoblue   |     `5/day` | `65000/day` |

For Meteoblue, one package request counts as `1` API call and currently costs
`16000` credits. The credit cap is therefore the binding limit: with the default
`65000` credit cap, at most `4` Meteoblue package calls fit in one billing day
because a fifth would require `80000` credits. The `5/day` call cap is a
secondary safety limit; the credit cap remains the practical Meteoblue
constraint.

One-time setup and recovery work can add temporary extra calls. Adding a station
uses one Weather.com validation call and one Open-Meteo elevation call. Backfill
and catchup can add Weather.com and Open-Meteo calls while filling missing
history.

## Local Checks

Run these before relying on a local build:

```sh
uv run pytest
uv run pyright wxverify
uv run ruff check wxverify tests
uv run ruff format --check wxverify tests
```
